# 01. Python Control Flow
# ------------------------------------
# - Control flow is the order in which statements or blocks of code are executed at runtime.
# - It determines the path of execution in a program based on conditions, loops, and function calls.
# - Control flow structures allow for decision making and repetition in programs, making them dynamic and versatile.
# - Python supports sequential, conditional (branching), and iterative (looping) control flow structures.

print("# 01. Python Control Flow")
print("# ------------------------------------")
print("# - Order of execution of code statements.")
print("# - Determines program's execution path based on conditions and loops.")
print("# - Enables decision making and repetition.")
print("# - Python supports sequential, conditional, and iterative control flow.")

# 02. If-Elif-Else Clause
# ------------------------------------
# - `if`, `elif` (else if), and `else` are conditional statements used to execute different blocks of code based on whether certain conditions are true or false.
# - `if` statement: Executes a block of code if a condition is true.
# - `elif` statement (optional, can have multiple): Checks for an additional condition if the preceding `if` or `elif` conditions are false.
# - `else` statement (optional, can have at most one): Executes a block of code if all preceding `if` and `elif` conditions are false.

print("\n# 02. If-Elif-Else Clause")
print("# ------------------------------------")
print("# - Conditional statements for executing code based on conditions.")
print("# - 'if': Execute if condition is true.")
print("# - 'elif': (optional) Check another condition if previous 'if' or 'elif' is false.")

# 03. For Loop
# ------------------------------------
# - `for` loop is used for iterating over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range) or other iterable objects.
# - It executes a block of code for each item in the sequence.
# - Useful for automating repetitive tasks on a collection of items.
# - Can be used with `else` clause which executes after the loop completes normally (i.e., not terminated by `break`).

print("\n# 03. For Loop")
print("# ------------------------------------")
print("# - Iterates over a sequence (list, tuple, string, range) or iterable.")
print("# - Executes a block of code for each item in the sequence.")
print("# - Used for repetitive tasks on collections.")
print("# - Optional 'else' clause executes after loop completion (if not broken).")

# Example of For Loop
print("\n# Example - For Loop:")
print("fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]")
print("for fruit in fruits:")
print("    print(\"Fruit:\", fruit)")

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print("    print(\"Fruit:\", fruit)") # This block executes for each item in fruits

print("\n# Example - For Loop with range():")
print("for i in range(3):")
print("    print(\"Number:\", i)")

for i in range(3):
    print("    print(\"Number:\", i)") # This block executes for each number in the range 0 to 2

print("\n# Example - For Loop with string:")
print("for char in \"Python\":")
print("    print(\"Character:\", char)")

for char in "Python":
    print("    print(\"Character:\", char)") # This block executes for each character in "Python"

print("\n# Example - For Loop with else clause:")
print("for i in range(3):")
print("    print(\"Looping, i:\", i)")
print("else:")
print("    print(\"Loop finished without break\")")

for i in range(3):
    print("    print(\"Looping, i:\", i)") # Loop iterates through 0, 1, 2
else:
    print("    print(\"Loop finished without break\")") # Else block executes after loop completes

print("\n# Example - For Loop with break (else clause not executed):")
print("for i in range(5):")
print("    if i == 3:")
print("        break")
print("    print(\"Looping, i:\", i)")
print("else:")
print("    print(\"Loop finished without break (this won't print)\")")

for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        break # Loop breaks when i is 3
    print("    print(\"Looping, i:\", i)")
else:
    print("    print(\"Loop finished without break (this won't print)\")") # Else block is skipped because loop was broken

# 04. While Loop
# ------------------------------------
# - `while` loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a condition is true.
# - The condition is checked at the start of each iteration.
# - It is essential to ensure that the condition eventually becomes false to avoid infinite loops.
# - Can be used with `else` clause which executes when the condition becomes false and the loop terminates normally (not by `break`).

print("# ------------------------------------")
print("# - Repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a condition is true.")
print("# - Condition is checked at the beginning of each iteration.")
print("# - Important to have a condition that eventually becomes false to avoid infinite loop.")
print("# - Optional 'else' clause executes when condition becomes false (if not broken).")

# Example of While Loop
print("\n# Example - While Loop:")
print("count = 0")
print("while count < 3:")
print("    print(\"Count is:\", count)")
print("    count += 1")

count = 0
while count < 3:
    print("    print(\"Count is:\", count)") # This block executes as long as count < 3
    count += 1

print("\n# Example - While Loop with else clause:")
print("count = 0")
print("while count < 3:")
print("    print(\"Count is:\", count)")
print("    count += 1")
print("else:")
print("    print(\"While loop condition is no longer true\")")

count = 0
while count < 3:
    print("    print(\"Count is:\", count)") # Loop continues as long as count < 3
    count += 1
else:
    print("    print(\"While loop condition is no longer true\")") # Else block executes when condition becomes false

print("\n# Example - While Loop with break (else clause not executed):")
print("count = 0")
print("while count < 5:")
print("    if count == 3:")

    if count == 3:
        break # Loop breaks when count is 3

    count += 1
else:
    print("    print(\"While loop condition is no longer true (this won't print)\")") # Else block skipped due to break

# 05. Break, Continue
# ------------------------------------
# - `break` and `continue` are statements that alter the flow of loops (both `for` and `while`).
# - `break` statement: Immediately terminates the loop and the program control flows to the statement immediately following the loop.
# - `continue` statement: Skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and continues to the next iteration.

print("\n# 05. Break, Continue")
print("# ------------------------------------")
print("# - Statements to alter loop flow.")
print("# - 'break': Terminate the loop immediately.")
print("# - 'continue': Skip current iteration and proceed to the next iteration.")

# Example of Break Statement
print("\n# Example - Break Statement in For Loop:")

print("    if i == 3:")
print("        break")
print("    print(\"i is:\", i)")
print("print(\"Loop exited due to break\")")

for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        break # Loop terminates when i is 3
    print("    print(\"i is:\", i)")
print("print(\"Loop exited due to break\")") # Executed after loop is broken

# Example of Continue Statement
print("\n# Example - Continue Statement in For Loop:")
print("for i in range(5):")
print("    if i == 2:")
print("        continue")
print("    print(\"i is:\", i)")
print("print(\"Loop finished\")")

for i in range(5):
    if i == 2:
        continue # Skips printing when i is 2, goes to next iteration
    print("    print(\"i is:\", i)")
print("print(\"Loop finished\")") # Loop completes all iterations (except skipped ones)

# Example Break in While Loop

# 07. Breaking Out of Nested Loops
# ------------------------------------
# - Python has no `break 2` / labeled loops like some other languages.
# - Common workarounds:
#   1. A flag variable checked by the outer loop.
#   2. Wrap the loops in a function and `return` (cleanest, most common).
#   3. itertools.product() to flatten nested iteration into a single loop.

                return (i, j)   # exits BOTH loops immediately

# 08. Ternary (Conditional) Expression Chaining
# ------------------------------------
# - The ternary form `value_if_true if condition else value_if_false` can be
#   chained to emulate an if/elif/elif/.../else ladder in one expression.
# - Readable for 2-3 branches; prefer a normal if/elif chain beyond that.

# 09. any() and all() - Short-Circuit Behavior
# ------------------------------------

# - all(iterable): True only if EVERY element is truthy. Stops at the

# 10. zip() with strict= (Python 3.10+)

# 11. range() is Lazy vs list(range())
# ------------------------------------
# - range() returns a lightweight lazy sequence object - it computes values

# - list(range()) eagerly materializes every value into memory upfront.
# - For simple iteration, prefer range() directly - never wrap it in list()
#   just to loop over it.
