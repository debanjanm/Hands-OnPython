# 01. Inheritance Introduction
# ------------------------------------
# - Inheritance is a fundamental principle in OOP that allows a class (child/derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (parent/base class).
# - It promotes code reusability and establishes an "is-a" relationship between classes. For example, a 'Dog' is a type of 'Animal'.
# - The derived class can inherit attributes and methods from the base class, and can also add new attributes and methods or modify inherited ones.
# - Inheritance forms a hierarchy of classes, making code organized and easier to extend and maintain.

print("# - Promotes code reusability and 'is-a' relationship (e.g., Dog is-a Animal).")
print("# - Derived class inherits attributes and methods, can add new or modify inherited ones.")
print("# - Forms class hierarchies, improves organization, extensibility, and maintenance.")

# 02. DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself
# ------------------------------------
# - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) is a principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns, replacing it with abstractions or data normalization to avoid redundancy.
# - Inheritance directly supports the DRY principle by allowing you to define common attributes and methods in a base class and reuse them in multiple derived classes.
# - Instead of rewriting the same code in different classes, you inherit the common parts, and only implement the specific functionalities in each derived class.
# - This reduces code length, improves maintainability (changes to common logic only need to be made in one place - the base class), and reduces the chance of errors due to inconsistencies in duplicated code.

print("# - Principle to reduce repetition in code, using abstractions instead.")
print("# - Inheritance directly supports DRY by reusing base class code in derived classes.")
print("# - Common attributes/methods defined once in base class, reused in derived classes.")
print("# - Reduces code, improves maintainability (single point of change), minimizes errors.")

# 03. What Gets Inherited?
# ------------------------------------
# - When a class inherits from a base class, it inherits:
#   - Public and protected members (attributes and methods) of the base class.
#   - Private members of the base class are technically inherited but are not directly accessible or modifiable in the derived class (due to name mangling in Python). However, they exist in the object instance of the derived class.
# - The derived class does not inherit:
#   - Constructors (`__init__` methods) of the base class are not automatically inherited in the sense of being directly called when a derived class object is created. However, you can explicitly call the base class constructor using `super().__init__()` in the derived class's constructor.

print("# - Derived class inherits:")
print("#   - Public and protected members (attributes and methods).")
print("#   - Private members (technically inherited but not directly accessible/modifiable due to name mangling).")
print("# - Derived class does not automatically inherit:")
print("#   - Constructors (__init__ methods). Need to be explicitly called using super().__init__().")

# 04. Method Overriding
# ------------------------------------
# - Method overriding is a feature in OOP where a derived class provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its base class.
# - When a method in a derived class has the same name, same parameters, or signature as a method in its base class, then the derived class's method is said to override the base class's method.
# - When you call an overridden method on an object of the derived class, the method in the derived class is executed, not the method from the base class.
# - Method overriding allows a derived class to extend or customize the behavior inherited from a base class.

print("\n# 04. Method Overriding")
print("# ------------------------------------")
print("# - Derived class provides specific implementation for a method already in base class.")
print("# - Same method name, same signature in derived class overrides base class method.")
print("# - Calling overridden method on derived class object executes derived class's method.")
print("# - Allows customization and extension of base class behavior in derived classes.")

# Example of Method Overriding
print("\n# Example - Method Overriding:")
print("class Animal:")
print("    def speak(self):")
print("        print(\"Generic animal sound\")")
print("class Dog(Animal):")
print("    def speak(self): # Method overriding")
print("        print(\"Woof!\")")

class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        print("Generic animal sound")

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self): # Method overriding
        print("Woof!")

animal = Animal()
dog = Dog()

print("# Class 'Animal' with method 'speak', class 'Dog' inheriting and overriding 'speak'.")
print("print(\"animal.speak():\")")
animal.speak() # Calls Animal's speak method
print("print(\"dog.speak():\")")
dog.speak() # Calls Dog's overridden speak method

print("\n# Output from Method Overriding Example:")
print("animal.speak():")
animal.speak()
print("dog.speak():")
dog.speak()

# 05. Super Keyword
# ------------------------------------
# - The `super()` keyword in Python is used to call a method from a parent class within a derived class.
# - It is commonly used in method overriding to extend the functionality of a base class method, rather than completely replacing it.
# - `super()` returns a temporary object of the superclass, allowing you to call superclass methods directly from the subclass.
# - It is especially useful in constructors (`__init__` methods) of derived classes to invoke the constructor of the base class to initialize inherited attributes.

# 07. Method Resolution Order (MRO) and C3 Linearization
# ------------------------------------
# - MRO is the order Python searches base classes when looking up a method
#   or attribute. `ClassName.__mro__` (or `ClassName.mro()`) shows that order.
# - Python computes MRO using the C3 linearization algorithm: a class always
#   comes before its parents, and parents keep the left-to-right order they
#   were listed in at the class definition - a consistent, predictable rule
#   that also detects impossible orderings and raises TypeError.

# 08. The Diamond Problem and Cooperative super()
# ------------------------------------
# - The "diamond": two classes (B, C) both inherit from A, and a fourth class
#   D inherits from both B and C - so A could be reached (and initialized)
#   through two different paths.
# - Calling `super().__init__()` in each class (instead of naming the parent
#   class directly) makes every class cooperate - each __init__ call is routed
#   along the MRO exactly once, so A's __init__ runs only a single time.
